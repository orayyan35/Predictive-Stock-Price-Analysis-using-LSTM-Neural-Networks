# Predictive-Stock-Price-Analysis-using-LSTM-Neural-Networks

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, making them suitable for sequential data like stock prices. By training the model on past stock price data, it learns patterns and trends to make future price predictions. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the LSTM model, evaluating its performance using metrics like root mean squared error  (RMSE),  and  finally , making predictions.
